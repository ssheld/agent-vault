# CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
This repository holds reusable scaffold files for `.agent-vault/`.

## Rules
- Edit `scaffold/.agent-vault/` for defaults used in future project initialization.
- Do not store project-specific context in this repository.

## Target Project Usage
In generated project vaults, use:
- `.agent-vault/context-log.md` as canonical handoff memory
- `.agent-vault/plan.md` and `.agent-vault/coding-standards.md` as execution constraints
- `.agent-vault/design-log/` and `.agent-vault/context/handoffs/` for session transfer
