# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository is a template source, not project memory.

## Rules
- Keep reusable defaults in `scaffold/agent-vault/`.
- Do not add project-specific notes or logs to this repository.
- Generate project context only via `scripts/new-project.sh`.

## Generated Project Standard
Inside a target repo, canonical shared memory is:
- `agent-vault/context-log.md`

Also read:
- `agent-vault/plan.md`
- `agent-vault/coding-standards.md`
- recent files in `agent-vault/design-log/`
- recent files in `agent-vault/context/handoffs/`
